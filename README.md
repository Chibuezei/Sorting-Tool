# Sorting-Tool
In the modern world, data has become so abundant that processing it is no easy business. How can anyone make sense of all these words and numbers? 
In this project, I wrote a program that processes textual and numeric data and sorts it. This program is be able to determine the biggest or most frequent pieces of data and perform the necessary calculations on them. Data is waiting to be sorted!
